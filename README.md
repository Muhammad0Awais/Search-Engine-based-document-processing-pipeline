# Search-Engine-based-document-processing-pipeline

In this Tutorial we are going to implement a standard document processing pipeline and then build a simple search engine based on it:
- starting from crawling documents, 
- then building an inverted index,
- answering queries using this index,
- and organizing it as a simple web server.
