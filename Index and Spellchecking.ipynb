In order to be able to do that, a good spell-checking mechanism should be incorporated into a search procedure.

K-grams is a list of consecutive k chars in a string - i.e., for the word *'star'*, it will be '*\\$st*', '*sta*', '*tar*', and '*ar$*', if we take k=3. Take a look at [book](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf) *chapter 3.2.2* to understand how k-grams can help efficiently match a wildcard against dictionary words. Here we will only consider wildcards with star symbols (may be multiple).\n",
